<h3>phonenumbers 8.13.7 library</h3>

Python version of Google's common library for parsing, formatting, storing and validating international phone numbers.

This is a Python port of Google's libphonenumber library It supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x (in the same codebase, with no 2to3 conversion needed).

<h4>Example Usage</h4>
The main object that the library deals with is a PhoneNumber object. You can create this from a string representing a phone number using the parse function, but you also need to specify the country that the phone number is being dialled from (unless the number is in E.164 format, which is globally unique).
